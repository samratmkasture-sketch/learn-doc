Becoming a proficient UI (User Interface) developer in 20 days is an ambitious goal, but with focus, discipline, and a structured plan, you can build a strong foundation and start creating professional-grade interfaces. This plan assumes you’re starting with little to no prior experience and aims to take you from beginner to intermediate level, ready to tackle real-world projects. Each day includes learning objectives, tasks, and resources, with a mix of theory, practice, and portfolio-building.

Prerequisites
Time Commitment: 4-6 hours daily (adjustable based on your pace).
Tools: A computer, code editor (e.g., VS Code), browser (Chrome/Firefox), and internet access.
