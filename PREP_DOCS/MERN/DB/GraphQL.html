Blue-green deployment
  Maintains two identical environments, one for production and one for the new version. This strategy allows for quick rollback if issues arise. 
Canary deployment
  Releases a new version to a small subset of users or servers. If problems are detected, the deployment can be halted or rolled back. 
Big bang deployment
  Involves making all changes at once, which can cause some downtime. This strategy is sometimes unavoidable for significant updates, like a database upgrade. 
Feature toggles
  Also known as feature flags, these are if/else blocks in application code that control whether a feature is available for a specific user. 
A/B versions
  Both versions are active at the same time, with some users using one version and some using the other. This strategy can be used to experiment with user interface changes and other features. 
Other deployment strategies include: In-place deployment, Linear deployment, Rolling deployment, Immutable deployment, and Traffic splitting deployment.
