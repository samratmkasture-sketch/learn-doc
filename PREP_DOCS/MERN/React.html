  - if you are working with team and one of the team member will not agree with UI component design pattern then how to handle that situation

Enums (enumerations) in programming, including TypeScript, serve a specific purpose: to define a set of named constants.  They make your code more readable, maintainable, and less prone to errors by replacing arbitrary values (like numbers or strings) with meaningful names.   

Here's a breakdown of the uses and benefits of enums:
1. Improved Readability:
2. Maintainability:
3. Type Safety:
4. Code Completion and Tooling:
5. Representing Finite Sets of Values:
6. Working with Data from APIs or Databases:

Generics in programming are a powerful feature that allows you to write reusable components or functions that can work with a variety of types without sacrificing type safety.  They essentially let you create "templates" for code that can be adapted to different data types.

New React 18 Features ::
------------------------
React 18 was released in March 2022 and has several new features and improvements that benefit users and developers. 

- Automatic Batching :
- Transitions
- Suspense on the server
  React 18 introduces: 
    1. Code splitting on the server with suspense
    2. Streaming rendering on the server
- Strict mode


https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/new-react-19-features-you-should-know-with-code-examples/#heading-react-19-features
React Compiler: The Magic Behind the Scenes
The star of React 19 is its new compiler. 🎉 This compiler transforms your React code into plain JavaScript, which boosts performance and, even better, frees you from constantly tweaking performance manually.

To optimize our React applications, we use some inbuilt methods like useMemo or useCallback. This tells React not to compile the code again if the inputs don’t change.
  - No More Memoization Hooks
  - No forwardRef: Simplified Ref Handling
  - Fetch Data with use() vs. useEffect
  - The New use() Hook: A Game Changer
The versatile new use() hook replaces multiple hooks, such as useEffect for data fetching as well as useContext and useState for consuming context data. It simplifies your code by handling promises and context with a single, elegant solution.
- Suspense and use(): When you use use(), it suspends the component rendering until the promise resolves. If an error occurs, it can also trigger a Suspense error boundary.
- Use Context with use()
Handling context data has also become more straightforward. The new use() hook can now consume context directly, eliminating the need for useContext and making context management more intuitive. 🎯

 - Directives: A Fresh Approach
  Use use client for client-side components and use server for server-side ones. It’s as easy as adding a string at the top of your file:

  - useFormStatus(): Managing Form State
Keep track of your form submissions with the useFormStatus() hook. 🕒 It helps manage form states like disabling the submit button while the form is pending. This is a must-have for smooth user experiences.

*********************************************************
React Fiber is an internal engine change geared to make React faster and smarter. The Fiber reconciler, which became the default reconciler for React 16 and above, is a complete rewrite of React's reconciliation algorithm to solve some long-standing issues in React.

Q1. Difference between let, var and const.
Q2. // Get output 1,2 without using let.
for(var i=0; i<=2; i++){
  setTimeout(function(){console.log(i)}, 1000);
}
Answer::
function print(i){
  setTimeout(function(){console.log(i)}, 1000)
}

for(var i=0; i<=2; i++){print(i)}

**********************************************************
what is sideeffects in react js?
in React, a side effect is an operation that occurs outside of a component's scope and affects the application's state or interacts with the external environment
https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/react-essentials-deep-dive-start-xmr985?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.css

New Feature ofreactjs 18V
https://react.dev/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18
Automatic Batching : 
      - Fewer rerenders for better performance
      - Works outside of event handelers
      - Safe but you can opt out when needed (flushSync)
  Suspence of serverside rendering : we have support for suspense on the server,which means by the help of suspense,you can wrap a slow part of your application,maybe like a comments component telling react to delay this loading
of the slow component, like comments.This can also be used to specify a loading state.So maybe we can show a spinner while comments is loading. 
  Code spiliting :  React 18 server rendering is also fully integrated with another optimization called code splitting. Previously it was hard to make server rendering work with code splitting,
  Concurrent : React 18 adds a few new APIs called concurrent features. They let you prove your applications performance by marking some state updates as non-urgent to keep the browser responsive. 
  Some of them are startTransition, useTransition, useDeferredValue.

hydrateRoot : when we render a React app on the server (instead of the browser), it generates HTML for our components. The hydrateRoot function is then used on the client side to attach event listeners and make the HTML interactive.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kZG3izJu7qE
hydrateRoot lets you display React components inside a browser DOM node whose HTML content was previously generated by react-dom/server.

const root = hydrateRoot(domNode, reactNode, options?)
i.renderToString()
ii.renderToStaticMarkup()

    Avoid Using State (if Possible)
    1. Opt for Fragments Instead of Divs Where Possible
    2. Virtualize long lists 
    If you render large lists of data, it is recommended that you render only a small portion of the datasets at a time within the visible viewport of a browser, then the next data are rendered as the lists is scrolled, this is called “windowing”. Awesome React libraries have been built for this, there is the react-window and react-virtuaized

How to Measure Performance

Debouncing concepts
Debouncing refers to ignoring the event handler call until the calls have stopped for a certain amount of time.
Avoid Using Inline Style Attribute
With inline styles, the browser spends a lot more time scripting and rendering.

A lot of time is spent on scripting because it has to map all the style rules passed to the actual CSS properties, which increases the rendering time for the component.
Let's imagine that we have an event with a debounce time of one second. The event handler for that event will be triggered after one second, once the user stops triggering the event.

The first step in improving the performance of a React application is to measure its current performance. There are several tools available for measuring performance, including:

Lighthouse – Lighthouse is an open-source tool from Google that audits web pages for performance, accessibility, and more. Lighthouse generates a report that includes suggestions for improving the performance of the application.
WebPageTest – WebPageTest is a free tool that allows you to test the speed of your website from multiple locations around the world. WebPageTest provides detailed reports on the performance of your website, including suggestions for improvement.
Google PageSpeed Insights – Google PageSpeed Insights analyzes the content of a web page and generates a report that identifies opportunities to improve the page's performance.

Render prop : “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

React best practices (optimisation)
https://www.makeuseof.com/must-follow-react-practices/

Code-splitting : To avoid winding up with a large bundle, it’s good to get ahead of the problem and start “splitting” your bundle. Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify (via factor-bundle) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
Code-splitting your app can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven’t reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you’ve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load.
Before:

 
import { add } from './math';

console.log(add(16, 26));
After:
import("./math").then(math => {
  console.log(math.add(16, 26));
});

React.lazy :
The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.
React.lazy takes a function that must call a dynamic import(). This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.

Fallback prop : The fallback prop accepts any React elements that you want to render while waiting for the component to load. You can place the Suspense component anywhere above the lazy component. You can even wrap multiple lazy components with a single Suspense component.

import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
8const AnotherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./AnotherComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <section>
          <OtherComponent />
          <AnotherComponent />
        </section>
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

Error handling in react : 
Error boundaries: 
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html

Context : Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html

Pure component :  React. Component doesn't implement shouldComponentUpdate() , but React. PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison. If your React component's render() function renders the same result given the same props and state.


 

It is the type of component which re-renders only when the props passed to it changes and not even if its parent component re-renders or if the shouldComponentUpdate() method is called. It is greatly used to enhance the performance of a web application.


useMemo vs useCallback : The main difference between useCallback and useMemo is the type of value they return. useCallback returns a memoized callback function, while useMemo returns a memoized value. Both hooks can be used to optimize the performance of your React components by avoiding unnecessary re-creations of functions or values.

Axios : Axios has built-in XSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, while Fetch does not. Axios has the ability to intercept HTTP requests but Fetch, by default, does not. Axios allows canceling requests and request timeout but fetch does not.

Redux - DataFlow
Thunk - 

Typescript

Semantic Tags : A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.
