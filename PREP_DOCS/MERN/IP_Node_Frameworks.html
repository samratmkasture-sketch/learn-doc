8. Scalability Challenges and Solutions:
Q: What are the common scalability challenges faced when building large-scale Node.js applications, and what architectural patterns or strategies do you employ to overcome them?

State Management in Distributed Systems:?
Q: Explain the difference between process.nextTick() and setImmediate(). When would you choose one over the other, and why?


Database Bottlenecks:
Challenge: The database often becomes the bottleneck as the application scales, especially with frequent read/write operations or complex queries.
Solutions:
Database connection pooling: Optimize database connection management to avoid overhead.
Database sharding/replication: Distribute data across multiple database instances to improve read/write capacity and availability.
Caching (Database-level and Application-level): Cache frequently accessed data to reduce database load.
Query optimization: Optimize inefficient database queries.
Denormalization: For read-heavy workloads, consider denormalizing data in NoSQL databases to reduce joins.
Choose appropriate database: Select a database technology (SQL vs. NoSQL) that best fits the application's data model and scaling needs.
