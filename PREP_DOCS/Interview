What is a prototype chain
  Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. i.e, When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, the created object inherits properties from a prototype object.

Web worker


display:none turns off the layout of the elements, so they are not rendered. visibility:hidden hides the elements without changing their layouts. 
What is semantic tags?
Semantic tags are HTML elements that define the meaning of the content they contain. They help make web pages more accessible, easier to read, and better for search engines. 
Here are some benefits of using semantic tags:
-Improved accessibility: Semantic tags make web pages easier to navigate and understand. 
-Better search engine optimization (SEO): Semantic tags give search engines better context for indexing content. 
-Easier maintenance: Semantic tags make it easier for developers to maintain and update web pages. 
-More comprehensible HTML: Semantic tags make HTML code more readable and understandable.

What is 1NF 2NF and 3NF?

--------------------------------------------

https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/database-normalization-1nf-2nf-3nf-table-examples/

The main purpose of database normalization is to avoid complexities, eliminate duplicates, and organize data in a consistent way. In normalization, the data is divided into several tables linked together with relationships.

Database administrators are able to achieve these relationships by using primary keys, foreign keys, and composite keys.

To get it done, a primary key in one table, for example, employee_wages is related to the value from another table, for instance, employee_data.

N.B.: A primary key is a column that uniquely identifies the rows of data in that table. It’s a unique identifier such as an employee ID, student ID, voter’s identification number (VIN), and so on.

A foreign key is a field that relates to the primary key in another table.

A composite key is just like a primary key, but instead of having a column, it has multiple columns.

The First Normal Form – 1NF
For a table to be in the first normal form, it must meet the following criteria:

a single cell must not hold more than one value (atomicity)
there must be a primary key for identification
no duplicated rows or columns
each column must have only one value for each row in the table
