CI/CD :
Continuous integration : Focuses on the build and unit testing stages of the software release process. CI automatically builds and tests code changes that are committed to a shared repository. 
Continuous delivery : Builds on CI to automatically build, test, and prepare code changes for release to production. CD also includes an automated release process, so you can deploy your application to production with the click of a button.

- What is GitHub Actions?
	GitHub Actions is a continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform that automates build, test, and deployment pipelines. It also allows you to execute code in the repository when certain events occur, making it easy to extend and customize.

	In GitHub Actions, “Actions” run by executing code bundles inside Docker containers. These code packages run on GitHub servers and are compatible with any programming language, meaning they can run on local servers or in the public cloud.



- What are the different components of a GitHub Actions workflow?
A workflow in GitHub Actions is defined using a YAML file stored in the .github/workflows directory of your repository. The file specifies the actions to be run, when they should be triggered, and on what events.
	1. Events: Events trigger workflows to run. For example, a workflow can be triggered when a commit is pushed to a repository.
	2. Jobs: Jobs are the steps of a workflow. They are independent and can run concurrently.
	3. Steps: Steps are the individual tasks that make up a job. They can be any command or script that you want to run.
	4. Actions: Actions are reusable components that are used to perform common tasks in workflows.
-What are runners in the context of GitHub Actions?
	Runners are the servers that execute the jobs defined in a GitHub Actions workflow. A runner can be GitHub-hosted in GitHub’s shared environments or self-hosted in your own infrastructure.
