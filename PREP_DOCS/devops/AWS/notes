----------------------------------------------------------------------
Six advantages of cloud computing :
1. Trade fixed expense for variable expense – Instead of having to invest heavily in data centers and servers before you know how you’re going to use them, you can pay only when you consume computing resources, and pay only for how much you consume.

2. Benefit from massive economies of scale – By using cloud computing, you can achieve a lower variable cost than you can get on your own. Because usage from hundreds of thousands of customers is aggregated in the cloud, providers such as AWS can achieve higher economies of scale, which translates into lower pay as-you-go prices.

3. Stop guessing capacity – Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs. When you make a capacity decision prior to deploying an application, you often end up either sitting on expensive idle resources or dealing with limited capacity. With cloud computing, these problems go away. You can access as much or as little capacity as you need, and scale up and down as required with only a few minutes’ notice.

4. Increase speed and agility – In a cloud computing environment, new IT resources are only a click away, which means that you reduce the time to make those resources available to your developers from weeks to just minutes. This results in a dramatic increase in agility for the organization, since the cost and time it takes to experiment and develop is significantly lower.

5. Stop spending money running and maintaining data centers – Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure. Cloud computing lets you focus on your own customers, rather than on the heavy lifting of racking, stacking, and powering servers.

6. Go global in minutes – Easily deploy your application in multiple regions around the world with just a few clicks. This means you can provide lower latency and a better experience for your customers at minimal cost.

------------------------------------------------
Correct options:

Anticipate failure

Make frequent, small, reversible changes

The Operational Excellence pillar includes the ability to run and monitor systems to deliver business value and to continually improve supporting processes and procedures.

Perform “pre-mortem” exercises to identify potential sources of failure so that they can be removed or mitigated. Test your failure scenarios and validate your understanding of their impact. Test your response procedures to ensure that they are effective, and that teams are familiar with their execution. Set up regular game days to test workloads and team responses to simulated events.

Design workloads to allow components to be updated regularly. Make changes in small increments that can be reversed if they fail (without affecting customers when possible).

The AWS Well-Architected Framework helps you understand the pros and cons of the decisions you make while building systems on AWS. By using the Framework you will learn architectural best practices for designing and operating reliable, secure, efficient, and cost-effective systems in the cloud. It provides a way for you to consistently measure your architectures against best practices and identify areas for improvement.

The AWS Well-Architected Framework is based on six pillars — Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, and Sustainability.

Overview of the six pillars of the AWS Well-Architected Framework:

AWS Auto Scaling can help you optimize your utilization and cost efficiencies when consuming AWS services so you only pay for the resources you need.

How AWS Auto Scaling works:  via - https://aws.amazon.com/autoscaling/

Amazon EC2 Reserved Instances (RI) provide a significant discount (up to 72%) compared to On-Demand pricing and provide a capacity reservation when used in a specific Availability Zone (AZ).

EC2 Pricing Options Overview:  via - https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/
------------------------------------------------
Network Access Control List (network ACL)

A Network Access Control List (network ACL) is an optional layer of security for your virtual private cloud (VPC) that acts as a firewall for controlling traffic in and out of one or more subnets (i.e. it works at the subnet level). A network ACL has separate inbound and outbound rules, and each rule can either allow or deny traffic.

Network Access Control List (network ACL) Overview:  via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-network-acls.html

------------------------------------------------
Server administration

Power/Cooling

AWS Pricing Calculator lets you explore AWS services and create an estimate for the cost of your use cases on AWS. You can model your solutions before building them, explore the price points and calculations behind your estimate, and find the available instance types and contract terms that meet your needs. This enables you to make informed decisions about using AWS. You can plan your AWS costs and usage or price out by setting up a new set of instances and services. AWS Pricing Calculator can be accessed at https://calculator.aws/#/.

AWS Pricing Calculator compares the cost of your applications in an on-premises or traditional hosting environment to AWS: server, storage, network, and IT labor. Therefore, you need to include every element relevant to these points of comparison.

Server administration is included in the IT labor costs.

Power/Cooling are included in the server, storage, and network cost.

------------------------------------------------
Domain registration

Health checks and monitoring

Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud Domain Name System (DNS) web service. It is designed to give developers and businesses an extremely reliable and cost-effective way to route end users to Internet applications by translating names like www.example.com into the numeric IP addresses like 192.0.2.1 that computers use to connect to each other.

------------------------------------------------
Vertical scaling

A vertically scalable system is constrained to running its processes on only one computer; in such systems, the only way to increase performance is to add more resources into one computer in the form of faster (or more) CPUs, memory, or storage.
------------------------------------------------
Create tags for each department

You can assign metadata to your AWS resources in the form of tags. Each tag is a label consisting of a user-defined key and value. Tags can help you manage, identify, organize, search for, and filter resources. You can create tags to categorize resources by purpose, owner, environment, or other criteria.

Typically, you use business tags such as cost center/business unit, customer, or project to associate AWS costs with traditional cost-allocation dimensions. But a cost allocation report can include any tag. This lets you associate costs with technical or security dimensions, such as specific applications, environments, or compliance programs.

Example of tagging for cost optimization:  via - https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws_tagging.html
