New React 18 Features ::
----------------------
Nodejs : 
https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-event-loop/
The event loop in Node.js consists of several phases, each of which performs a specific task

1.Timers , 2.Pending Callbacks ,3. Idle, Prepare , 4. Poll, 5.Check, 6. Close Callbacks
Eventloop in NodeJS: MacroTasks and MicroTasks
https://medium.com/dkatalis/eventloop-in-nodejs-macrotasks-and-microtasks-164417e619b9
ANS :
    V8 Engine works by enqueuing tasks into the event loop.
    The tasks are broken down further into microtask and macrotask
       1. macroTasks: setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, requestAnimationFrame, I/O, UI rendering
       2. microTasks: process.nextTick, Promises, queueMicrotask, MutationObserver
    Only after tasks in microTasks are completed/ excahusted, event loop will next pick up one task from macroTasks. And this repeats.

**********
Node.js - Global Objects : __filename,__dirname, setTimeout(cb, ms), clearTimeout(t), setInterval(cb, ms)
                             Console:Used to print information on stdout and stderr.

                           2  Process:Used to get information on current process. Provides multiple events related to process activities.

Node.js - Utility Modules : 
1  OS Module
Provides basic operating-system related utility functions.

2  Path Module
Provides utilities for handling and transforming file paths.

3  Net Module
Provides both servers and clients as streams. Acts as a network wrapper.

4  DNS Module
Provides functions to do actual DNS lookup as well as to use underlying operating system name resolution functionalities.

5  Domain Module
Provides ways to handle multiple different I/O operations as a single group.


************
Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js.
next()
What is callback hell?

Core Modules : HTTP, util, fs , url, query string, stream, zib

Node.js Cluster Process Module
   The cluster module provides a way of creating child processes that runs simultaneously and share the same server port.

   Node.js runs single threaded programming, which is very memory efficient, but to take advantage of computers multi-core systems, the Cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that each runs on their own single thread, to handle the load.

The Child Processes Module
   We can easily spin a child process using Node’s child_process module and those child processes can easily communicate with each other with a messaging system.
   There are four different ways to create a child process in Node: spawn(), fork(), exec(), and execFile().
   https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-js-child-processes-everything-you-need-to-know-e69498fe970a/

CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) 

how request processed once
What are streams in Node.js?
Readable – Used for reading operations
Writable − Used for write operation
Duplex − Can be used for both reading and write operations
Transform − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input

Process Model : https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/nodejs-process-model
   Event loop : 
   Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.

   Thread Pool : Node.js uses libev for the event loop which in turn uses internal C++ thread pool to provide asynchronous I/O.

Express.js is based on the Node.js middleware module called connect which in turn uses http module. 
   Advantages of Express.js
   Makes Node.js web application development fast and easy.
   Easy to configure and customize.
   Allows you to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.
   Includes various middleware modules which you can use to perform additional tasks on request and response.
   Easy to integrate with different template engines like Jade, Vash, EJS etc.
   Allows you to define an error handling middleware.
   Easy to serve static files and resources of your application.
   Allows you to create REST API server.
   Easy to connect with databases such as MongoDB, Redis, MySQL

24. What are the two types of API functions in Node.js?
The two types of API functions in Node.js are:

Asynchronous, non-blocking functions
Synchronous, blocking functions

4. Why is Node.js preferred over other backend technologies like Java and PHP?
         Some of the reasons why Node.js is preferred include:
         Node.js is very fast
         Node Package Manager has over 50,000 bundles available at the developer’s disposal
         Perfect for data-intensive, real-time web applications, as Node.js never waits for an API to return data
         Better synchronization of code between server and client due to same code base
         Easy for web developers to start using Node.js in their projects as it is a JavaScript library

5. Differentiate between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?
The distinction between method and product. This is accomplished through the use of nextTick() and setImmediate(). next Tick() postpones the execution of action until the next pass around the event loop, or it simply calls the callback function once the event loop's current execution is complete, whereas setImmediate() executes a callback on the next cycle of the event loop and returns control to the event loop for any I/O operations.

How to Measure Performance

Debouncing concepts
Debouncing refers to ignoring the event handler call until the calls have stopped for a certain amount of time.
Avoid Using Inline Style Attribute
With inline styles, the browser spends a lot more time scripting and rendering.

A lot of time is spent on scripting because it has to map all the style rules passed to the actual CSS properties, which increases the rendering time for the component.
Let's imagine that we have an event with a debounce time of one second. The event handler for that event will be triggered after one second, once the user stops triggering the event.

The first step in improving the performance of a React application is to measure its current performance. There are several tools available for measuring performance, including:

Lighthouse – Lighthouse is an open-source tool from Google that audits web pages for performance, accessibility, and more. Lighthouse generates a report that includes suggestions for improving the performance of the application.
WebPageTest – WebPageTest is a free tool that allows you to test the speed of your website from multiple locations around the world. WebPageTest provides detailed reports on the performance of your website, including suggestions for improvement.
Google PageSpeed Insights – Google PageSpeed Insights analyzes the content of a web page and generates a report that identifies opportunities to improve the page's performance.

Render prop : “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic.

reconcilation
React best practices (optimisation)
https://www.makeuseof.com/must-follow-react-practices/

Code-splitting : To avoid winding up with a large bundle, it’s good to get ahead of the problem and start “splitting” your bundle. Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify (via factor-bundle) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime.
Code-splitting your app can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven’t reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you’ve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load.
Before:






import { add } from './math';

console.log(add(16, 26));
After:
import("./math").then(math => {
  console.log(math.add(16, 26));
});

React.lazy :
The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component.
React.lazy takes a function that must call a dynamic import(). This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component.

Fallback prop : The fallback prop accepts any React elements that you want to render while waiting for the component to load. You can place the Suspense component anywhere above the lazy component. You can even wrap multiple lazy components with a single Suspense component.

import React, { Suspense } from 'react';

const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
8const AnotherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./AnotherComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <section>
          <OtherComponent />
          <AnotherComponent />
        </section>
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
}

React final form

Error handling in react : 
Error boundaries: 
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html

Context : Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level.
Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components
https://legacy.reactjs.org/docs/context.html

Pure component :  React. Component doesn't implement shouldComponentUpdate() , but React. PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison. If your React component's render() function renders the same result given the same props and state.

 

It is the type of component which re-renders only when the props passed to it changes and not even if its parent component re-renders or if the shouldComponentUpdate() method is called. It is greatly used to enhance the performance of a web application.


useMemo vs useCallback : The main difference between useCallback and useMemo is the type of value they return. useCallback returns a memoized callback function, while useMemo returns a memoized value. Both hooks can be used to optimize the performance of your React components by avoiding unnecessary re-creations of functions or values.

Axios : Axios has built-in XSRF(Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection, while Fetch does not. Axios has the ability to intercept HTTP requests but Fetch, by default, does not. Axios allows canceling requests and request timeout but fetch does not.

Typescript

Semantic Tags : A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and the developer.
Examples of non-semantic elements: <div> and <span> - Tells nothing about its content.
Examples of semantic elements: <form>, <table>, and <article> - Clearly defines its content.

AWS LAMBDA
---------------------
=> Deployment package size is calculated based on the combination of all the layers and the function code
=> You can add up to five layers to a Lambda function. The total unzipped size of the function 
and all layers cannot exceed the unzipped deployment package size quota of 250 MB.
=> By default, Lambda provides your account with a total concurrency limit of 1,000 across all functions in a region.
   To support your specific account needs, you can request a quota increase and configure function-level concurrency controls so that your critical functions don't experience throttling.

=> In Lambda, concurrency is the number of requests your function can handle at the same time. There are two types of concurrency controls available:

Reserved concurrency – Reserved concurrency guarantees the maximum number of concurrent instances for the function. When a function has reserved concurrency, no other function can use that concurrency. There is no charge for configuring reserved concurrency for a function.

Provisioned concurrency – Provisioned concurrency initializes a requested number of execution environments so that they are prepared to respond immediately to your function's invocations. Note that configuring provisioned concurrency incurs charges to your AWS account.
