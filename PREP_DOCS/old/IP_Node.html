A lot of time is spent on scripting because it has to map all the style rules passed to the actual CSS properties, which increases the rendering time for the component.
Let's imagine that we have an event with a debounce time of one second. The event handler for that event will be triggered after one second, once the user stops triggering the event.

The first step in improving the performance of a React application is to measure its current performance. There are several tools available for measuring performance, including:

Lighthouse – Lighthouse is an open-source tool from Google that audits web pages for performance, accessibility, and more. Lighthouse generates a report that includes suggestions for improving the performance of the application.
WebPageTest – WebPageTest is a free tool that allows you to test the speed of your website from multiple locations around the world. WebPageTest provides detailed reports on the performance of your website, including suggestions for improvement.
Google PageSpeed Insights – Google PageSpeed Insights analyzes the content of a web page and generates a report that identifies opportunities to improve the page's performance.

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/node-js-event-loop/
he event loop in Node.js consists of several phases, each of which performs a specific task

1.Timers , 2.Pending Callbacks ,3. Idle, Prepare , 4. Poll, 5.Check, 6. Close Callbacks
Eventloop in NodeJS: MacroTasks and MicroTasks
https://medium.com/dkatalis/eventloop-in-nodejs-macrotasks-and-microtasks-164417e619b9
ANS :
    V8 Engine works by enqueuing tasks into the event loop.
    The tasks are broken down further into microtask and macrotask
       1. macroTasks: setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, requestAnimationFrame, I/O, UI rendering
       2. microTasks: process.nextTick, Promises, queueMicrotask, MutationObserver
    Only after tasks in microTasks are completed/ excahusted, event loop will next pick up one task from macroTasks. And this repeats.

**********
Node.js - Global Objects : __filename,__dirname, setTimeout(cb, ms), clearTimeout(t), setInterval(cb, ms)
                             Console:Used to print information on stdout and stderr.

                           2  Process:Used to get information on current process. Provides multiple events related to process activities.

Node.js - Utility Modules : 
1  OS Module
Provides basic operating-system related utility functions.

2  Path Module
Provides utilities for handling and transforming file paths.

3  Net Module
Provides both servers and clients as streams. Acts as a network wrapper.

4  DNS Module
Provides functions to do actual DNS lookup as well as to use underlying operating system name resolution functionalities.

5  Domain Module
Provides ways to handle multiple different I/O operations as a single group.

Core Modules : HTTP, util, fs , url, query string, stream, zib

Node.js Cluster Process Module
   The cluster module provides a way of creating child processes that runs simultaneously and share the same server port.

   Node.js runs single threaded programming, which is very memory efficient, but to take advantage of computers multi-core systems, the Cluster module allows you to easily create child processes that each runs on their own single thread, to handle the load.

The Child Processes Module
   We can easily spin a child process using Node’s child_process module and those child processes can easily communicate with each other with a messaging system.
   There are four different ways to create a child process in Node: spawn(), fork(), exec(), and execFile().

What are streams in Node.js?
Readable – Used for reading operations
Writable − Used for write operation
Duplex − Can be used for both reading and write operations
Transform − A type of duplex stream where the output is computed based on input

Process Model : https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/nodejs/nodejs-process-model
   Event loop : 
   Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.

   Thread Pool : Node.js uses libev for the event loop which in turn uses internal C++ thread pool to provide asynchronous I/O.

Express.js is based on the Node.js middleware module called connect which in turn uses http module. 
   Advantages of Express.js
   Makes Node.js web application development fast and easy.
   Easy to configure and customize.
   Allows you to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.
   Includes various middleware modules which you can use to perform additional tasks on request and response.
   Easy to integrate with different template engines like Jade, Vash, EJS etc.
   Allows you to define an error handling middleware.
   Easy to serve static files and resources of your application.
   Allows you to create REST API server.
   Easy to connect with databases such as MongoDB, Redis, MySQL

24. What are the two types of API functions in Node.js?
The two types of API functions in Node.js are:

Asynchronous, non-blocking functions
Synchronous, blocking functions

4. Why is Node.js preferred over other backend technologies like Java and PHP?
         Some of the reasons why Node.js is preferred include:
         Node.js is very fast
         Node Package Manager has over 50,000 bundles available at the developer’s disposal
         Perfect for data-intensive, real-time web applications, as Node.js never waits for an API to return data
         Better synchronization of code between server and client due to same code base
         Easy for web developers to start using Node.js in their projects as it is a JavaScript library

5. Differentiate between process.nextTick() and setImmediate()?
The distinction between method and product. This is accomplished through the use of nextTick() and setImmediate(). next Tick() postpones the execution of action until the next pass around the event loop, or it simply calls the callback function once the event loop's current execution is complete, whereas setImmediate() executes a callback on the next cycle of the event loop and returns control to the event loop for any I/O operations.
