let's learn about npm Scripts
an npm script is a convenient way to bundle common commands for use in a
project they are typically entered in the command line in order to do something with the application
npm scripts are stored in a Project's package.json file giving access to everyone who has access to the code base
they also ensure that everyone is using the same command with the same options common use cases for npm scripts include building your project starting a Dev server compiling CSS linting minifying Etc
npm scripts are executed using the command npm run followed by the script name
let's head back to vs code and take a

when we run the command npm init it generates a scripts Field in package.json this contains a test script that just prints to the console now test is specified this is not so useful so let's add one on our own
let's create a simple script that is going to run our node application which is of course index.js in our
scenario the script name I'm going to call it start and the command this script is going to run is node index.js
save the file and in the terminal within the project folder run the command npm Run start this will run index.js and give us the expected output hello vishwas welcome to code evolution

now a start script is something you would typically see in every project it helps everyone in the team get started
easily without having to understand all the commands that need to be run

Node.js Introduction
Official Documenation 
https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs





Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

What is the difference between Node.js and JavaScript?

What Can Node.js Do?
Node.js can generate dynamic page content
Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
Node.js can collect form data
Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
What is a Node.js File?
Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
Node.js files have extension ".js"

-> nodejs Modules -> it is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple javascript files which can be reused throught the application. Each module in nodejs has its own context, so ith cannot interfere with other modules or polute global scope. 
   it help developer to work faster and write structured code.
	- Core modules
	- Local modules
	- ThirdParty Modules
