Node.js Introduction
Official Documenation 
https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/introduction-to-nodejs

What Can Node.js Do?
Node.js can generate dynamic page content
Node.js can create, open, read, write, delete, and close files on the server
Node.js can collect form data
Node.js can add, delete, modify data in your database
What is a Node.js File?
Node.js files contain tasks that will be executed on certain events
A typical event is someone trying to access a port on the server
Node.js files must be initiated on the server before having any effect
Node.js files have extension ".js"



Node.js runs on various platforms (Windows, Linux, Unix, Mac OS X, etc.)
Node.js uses JavaScript on the server

-> nodejs Modules -> it is a simple or complex functionality organized in single or multiple javascript files which can be reused throught the application. Each module in nodejs has its own context, so it cannot interfere with other modules or polute global scope. 
   it help developer to work faster and write structured code.
	- Core modules
	- Local modules
	- ThirdParty Modules

Blocking vs Non-Blocking
**************************************************************************************
 In Node.js, the terms "blocking" and "non-blocking" refer to the way in which I/O operations are handled in the event-driven architecture of Node.js. Here's a simplified explanation:

Blocking:

Blocking I/O operations are synchronous, meaning that when a piece of code requests an I/O operation (like reading from a file or making a network request), the program waits until the operation completes before proceeding to the next line of code.
During this waiting period, the Node.js event loop is blocked, and no other operations can be processed. This can lead to decreased performance and scalability, especially in applications with high I/O demands.
Example: Reading a large file synchronously using fs.readFileSync().
Non-Blocking:

Non-blocking I/O operations are asynchronous, meaning that when a piece of code requests an I/O operation, it continues to execute without waiting for the operation to complete.
Once the operation is completed, a callback function is invoked to handle the result. In the meantime, the event loop remains free to process other tasks, improving performance and scalability.
Example: Reading a file asynchronously using fs.readFile() with a callback function to handle the result.
In summary, blocking operations halt the execution of code until the operation is completed, while non-blocking operations allow code to continue executing without waiting, resulting in better performance and responsiveness, especially in I/O-intensive applications. Node.js promotes the use of non-blocking, asynchronous I/O to maximize throughput and scalability.
