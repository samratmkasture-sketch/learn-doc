Singleton pattern:
  A Singleton is an object which can only be instantiated one time. Repeated calls to its constructor return the same instance. This way one can ensure that they don't accidentally create multiple instances.

  var object = new (function () {
    this.name = "Sudheer";
  })();

What is a prototype chain
  Prototype chaining is used to build new types of objects based on existing ones. It is similar to inheritance in a class based language. i.e, When you create an object using a constructor function or a class, the created object inherits properties from a prototype object.
