--------------------------------------------------------
  Monolithic
  A traditional model where all application components are tightly bundled together in a single codebase. Monolithic applications are complex and can be challenging to develop and deploy. However, they are simpler for small teams and can offer better performance. 
   
  SOA
  A model where an application is built from reusable services that communicate with each other over a network. SOA is well-suited for complex enterprise systems. It can simplify applications and make them more scalable. However, SOA systems can become complex over time and can be difficult to debug. 
   
  Here are some other differences between monolithic and SOA:
  Development: Monolithic applications are simpler to develop and deploy. 
   
  Scalability: SOA systems can be scaled by adding or removing services, rather than scaling the entire application. 
   
  Fault tolerance: SOA systems are more fault tolerant because if one service fails, the entire system doesn't shut down. 
   
  Reuse: SOA services can be reused in new developments. 
   
  Communication: SOA systems use an Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) to facilitate communication between services. 
   
  Complexity: SOA systems can become complex over time as services become interdependent. 
   
  Performance: Communication over the network in SOA systems can add latency compared to monolithic applications.

 gRPC (gRPC Remote Procedure Calls) is a cross-platform open source high performance remote procedure call (RPC) framework.

gRPC, unlike REST, was designed specifically to allow developers to create high-performance APIs for microservice architectures across distributed data centers. It's better suited for internal systems that require real-time streaming and large data loads
