Key Forex Terminologies (In English)
Forex (Foreign Exchange): The global market where currencies are traded. For example, exchanging US Dollars (USD) for Euros (EUR).
Currency Pair: Two currencies traded against each other, e.g., EUR/USD (Euro vs. US Dollar). The first currency is the "base," and the second is the "quote."
Pip: The smallest price movement in a currency pair, usually the fourth decimal place (e.g., 0.0001). It measures profit or loss.
Lot: The size of a trade. A standard lot is 100,000 units of the base currency, but beginners often use micro lots (1,000 units).
Leverage: Borrowed money from a broker to increase your trading position. E.g., 1:100 leverage means $1 controls $100.
Margin: The amount of money you need in your account to open a leveraged trade.
Bid/Ask Price: Bid is the price you can sell at, and Ask is the price you can buy at. The difference is called the "spread."
Spread: The cost of trading, calculated as the difference between the bid and ask prices.
Bullish/Bearish: Bullish means the price is expected to rise, and bearish means it’s expected to fall.
Stop Loss/Take Profit: Tools to automatically close a trade to limit losses or lock in profits at a set price.
