Monorepo - A monorepo is a massive codebase containing independent projects, whereas a monolith (or monolithic application) is a service or set of services dedicated to a single dataset (or project). The dataset, however, can have many sub-projects. But, typically, we think of a monolith and a single entity with related data.
A monorepo is a version-controlled code repository that holds many projects. While these projects may be related, they are often logically independent and run by different teams. Some companies host all their code in a single repository, shared among everyone.

	** Design Patterns **
----------------------------
Design Patterns:-> https://medium.com/@SilentHackz/4-javascript-design-patterns-you-should-know-9b8e6c3abdaf

-> Creational design patterns :- Its all about class instantiation (How objects are created?)
    1. *Abstract Factory
    2. *Builder
    3. *Factory Method
    4. *Prototype
    5. *Singleton

  
-> Structural design patterns :- (How Objects relate to each other?)
	Facade | Proxy |    
	
	*Facade (Wrapper class to abstract lower level details to hide complexities)
	
	1. *Adapter
	2. Bridge
	3. Composite
	4. Decorator
	5. *Facade 
	6. Flyweight
	7. Private Class Data
	8. *Proxy
	
-> Behavioral Pattern : - (How Objects communicate with each Other?)
(Observer, Iterator)
	1. Chain of responsibility
    2. Command
    3. Interpreter
    4. Mediator
    5. Memento
    6. Null Object
    7. *Observer 
    8. State
    9. Strategy
   10. Template method
   11. Visitor

	**Principals**
----------------------
-> SOLID : Yet another common programming principle. This one though, stands for:
https://blog.bitsrc.io/kiss-solid-yagni-and-other-fun-acronyms-b5d207530335
	1. Single Responsibility Principle
	2. Open-Closed Principle (Open for extention | Closed for modification)
	3. Liskov Substitution Principle (Subtypes must be substitutable to their base types| Use inheritance when your super class is replacecable by subclass in all instances )
	4. Interface Segregation Principle :- This one references the fact that you should not expose your users (i.e developers using your code) to unneeded methods. So if you’re creating interfaces (for example in TypeScript), make sure the required methods that need to be implemented are the ones your users will need, don’t force them to implement methods that are optional.
	5. Dependency Inversion Principle : this principle states that if you have dependencies in your code, you should allow for them to be injected into your logic. By allowing them to be passed in as parameters.
-> SOC : Separation Of Concerns
-> DRY : DO not repeat your self
-> YAGNI : “You ain’t gonna need it”
-> KISS : Keep It Simple Stupid (or if you don’t like to be called stupid, you can think of it as Keep It Stupid Simple, which I think works even better for the actual meaning of the acronym).
-> BDUF :  “Big Design Up Front” it states that you should spend more time fully designing the application before you even write the first line of code.
-> POC :  it is only meant as a practical proof that the core functionality of what you’re trying to build is possible.






KISS : https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/keep-it-simple-stupid-how-to-use-the-kiss-principle-in-design/
YAGNI : The YAGNI or “You ain’t gonna need it” principle implies that you should only implement functionality after you need it.
