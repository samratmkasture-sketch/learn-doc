Q. what is Go, and why would you use it?
Ans: 
Golang, is a statically-typed, compiled programming language designed for simplicity and efficiency.

it's an open-source programming language developed and published by Google.
	It's a relatively new programming language. It was developed in 2007 and made public in 2009.

	It's an extremely popular programming language because of its focus on simplicity, clarity, and scalability because it offers great performance

	It has a strong focus on concurrency, so on running multiple tasks simultaneously,

	With a lot of important features built in, so that we don't need to reach for a of third-party libraries to perform basic tasks.

	Because it's sthetically typed language, giving us extra-type safety and allowing to catch and fix many errors pretty early during development instead of testing your application and catching errors at runtime.
	Because of these advantages, Go is pretty popular for developing network applications and APIs, microservice applications, and also CLI Tools Command-Line Interface Tools.

 

Q. make() vs new() - Similarities & Differences 
new() and make() functions. While both are used for memory allocation, 
- make() function is used for initializing slices, maps, and channels – data structures that require runtime initialization
- usually for data types like structs.
- The new() function in Go is a built-in function that allocates memory for a new zeroed value of a specified type and returns a pointer to it. Use make() for Reference Types:
 For slices, maps, and channels, where initialization involves setting up data structures and internal pointers, use make() to create an initialized instance.

- Use new() for Value Types :
	When dealing with value types like structs, you can use new() to allocate memory for a new zeroed value. This is suitable for scenarios where you want a pointer to an initialized structure.
    new() returns a pointer, while make() returns a non-zeroed value

Basic Questions
https://www.interviewbit.com/golang-interview-questions/

Q. What is Go (Golang)?
Ans: Go is an open-source programming language developed by Google. It is statically typed, compiled, and designed for simplicity, efficiency, and scalability.

Q. Why is Go called a statically typed language?
Ans:Go requires the type of a variable to be specified at compile time, ensuring type safety and faster execution.
Q. What are the advantages of Go?
Ans:
Simple syntax
Fast compilation
Built-in concurrency support with goroutines and channels
Automatic garbage collection
Strong standard library
Q. What is the purpose of a Go workspace?
Ans: A Go workspace is a directory hierarchy that contains Go code, including src (source code), bin (compiled binaries), and pkg (compiled package objects).
Q. What are Go modules?
Modules are collections of Go packages. They allow versioning and dependency management, introduced in Go 1.11.
Syntax and Language Features
What is the Go package structure?

Go code is organized into packages, with each package corresponding to a directory. The main package is the entry point for executable programs.
How do you declare variables in Go?

go
Copy code
var x int = 10
y := 20 // shorthand declaration
What are the basic data types in Go?

Integer types: int, int8, int16, int32, int64
Floating-point types: float32, float64
Boolean: bool
String: string
What are pointers in Go?

Pointers store memory addresses of variables. For example:
go
Copy code
var x = 10
var p = &x // p is a pointer to x
What are slices in Go?

Slices are dynamically-sized, flexible views into arrays. For example:
go
Copy code
arr := [5]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
slice := arr[1:4] // slice = [2, 3, 4]
Concurrency and Goroutines
What are goroutines?

Goroutines are lightweight threads managed by the Go runtime. For example:
go
Copy code
go func() {
    fmt.Println("Hello, Goroutine!")
}()
What are channels in Go?

Channels are used for communication between goroutines. For example:
go
Copy code
ch := make(chan int)
ch <- 5       // send 5 to channel
fmt.Println(<-ch) // receive from channel
What is the difference between buffered and unbuffered channels?

Buffered channels: Allow limited values to be stored without an immediate receiver.
Unbuffered channels: Block the sender until a receiver is ready.
How does the select statement work?

The select statement waits for one of multiple channel operations to proceed. Example:
go
Copy code
select {
case msg := <-ch1:
    fmt.Println("Received:", msg)
case ch2 <- value:
    fmt.Println("Sent:", value)
default:
    fmt.Println("No operation")
}
What are mutexes in Go?

A mutex is a synchronization primitive used to prevent race conditions. For example:
go
Copy code
var mu sync.Mutex
mu.Lock()
// critical section
mu.Unlock()
Error Handling
How does Go handle errors?

Go uses explicit error handling. Functions return an error type as the last return value.
go
Copy code
result, err := someFunction()
if err != nil {
    fmt.Println(err)
}
What is the defer statement?

defer is used to ensure a function call is executed after the surrounding function completes, often for cleanup:
go
Copy code
defer fmt.Println("End")
What is a panic in Go?

A panic is a runtime error that stops the program. It can be recovered using the recover function.
How does recover work?

recover is used to handle panics and prevent program termination:
go
Copy code
defer func() {
    if r := recover(); r != nil {
        fmt.Println("Recovered:", r)
    }
}()
What is the difference between panic and error?

Error: Used for predictable, recoverable problems.
Panic: Used for unexpected, unrecoverable errors.
Advanced Concepts
What is an interface in Go?

An interface defines a set of methods that a type must implement:
go
Copy code
type Shape interface {
    Area() float64
}
How are interfaces implemented in Go?

Interfaces are implemented implicitly by any type that defines its methods.
What is type assertion?

Type assertion retrieves the concrete type of an interface value:
go
Copy code
var i interface{} = "hello"
s := i.(string) // assert i is of type string
What is the select statement used for?

It waits for one of several channel communications to proceed, handling concurrent tasks.
What is a nil pointer?

A nil pointer points to no memory location.
Memory Management
Does Go support manual memory management?

No, Go uses garbage collection for automatic memory management.
What is the purpose of the new function?

Allocates zero-initialized memory and returns a pointer to it:
go
Copy code
p := new(int) // *int
What is the purpose of the make function?

Used to initialize slices, maps, and channels:
go
Copy code
slice := make([]int, 5)
Standard Library and Packages
How do you format output in Go?

Using the fmt package:
go
Copy code
fmt.Printf("Hello, %s!", "World")
What is the io package in Go?

Provides interfaces for I/O operations, such as Reader and Writer.
What is the reflect package in Go?

Provides tools to inspect and manipulate the type and value of variables at runtime.
What is the sync package used for?

Provides synchronization primitives like Mutex, WaitGroup, etc.
Testing and Performance
How do you write a test in Go?

Use the testing package:
go
Copy code
func TestAdd(t *testing.T) {
    if Add(2, 3) != 5 {
        t.Error("Expected 5")
    }
}
How do you benchmark code in Go?

Use testing.B for benchmarks:
go
Copy code
func BenchmarkAdd(b *testing.B) {
    for i := 0; i < b.N; i++ {
        Add(2, 3)
    }
}
How do you profile a Go program?

Use the pprof tool for CPU and memory profiling.
Miscellaneous
How do you manage dependencies in Go?

Using Go modules (go mod commands).
What is the difference between run and build in Go?

go run: Compiles and executes a Go program.
go build: Compiles a Go program into an executable.
What are build tags?

Build tags allow conditional compilation.
What is the runtime package?

Provides functions to interact with the Go runtime, like NumGoroutine.
What are custom types in Go?

User-defined types based on existing types:
go
Copy code
type Age int
Debugging and Tools
What is the go fmt tool?

Formats Go source code.
What is the go vet tool?

Analyzes code for potential errors.
How do you use the log package?

For logging messages:
go
Copy code
log.Println("Info message")
What is the os package?

Provides platform-independent interfaces for operating system functions.
How do you handle JSON in Go?

Using the encoding/json package:
go
Copy code
json.Marshal() // convert struct to JSON
json.Unmarshal() // parse JSON to struct
What are code comments in Go?

Single-line (//) and multi-line (/* */) comments.
What are Go routines compared to threads?

Goroutines are more lightweight than OS threads, with a smaller
