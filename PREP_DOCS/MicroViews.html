    What is Module Federation?
Simply put, Module Federation involves: A collection of independent remote software modules. Each module is autonomous and fully self contained. Multiple modules are dynamically loaded at runtime to form a single page application, often referred to as the shell or host application.

Module Federation is ideal for developing one or more applications involving multiple teams. This could be UI components, logical functionality, middleware, or even just server code or sideEffects. These parts can be shared and developed by independent teams.
