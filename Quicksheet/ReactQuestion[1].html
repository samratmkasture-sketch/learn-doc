What are Pure Components?

In React, we can create a component by extending the PureComponent class.
 A Pure Component implements the shouldComponentUpdate lifecycle method by performing a shallow comparison on the props and state
of the component. 
If there is no difference, the component is not re-rendered thereby providing a performance boost.
